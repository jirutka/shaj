Shaj is very old library originally created by the company Cenqua, later acquired 
by [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/). This repository is copied from the
[Atlassian’s SVN](https://svn.atlassian.com/fisheye/browse/public/atlassian/shaj/trunk/).
**I don’t recommend to use it** as it’s not maintained anymore, but some projects
as [OpenFire](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/) is still using 
it (and that’s the reason of this repo).
